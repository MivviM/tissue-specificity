Here are the steps to reproduce the results of the modified Bayesian 
approach presented in the manuscript "Combining evidence of preferential
Gene-Tissue relationships from multiple sources". Not all datasets 
that are in the manuscript are in here - only those that have replicates. 
Also, you do not need to run any of the scripts that are in the 
commonfiles directory.

1. Create a folder and extract the content of 
   Bayesian-tissue-specificity.rar. 
1. For each of the dataset folders (GDS596, GDS3113, GSE7307, GSE952, GSE9954) 
   run first simfile.R then the (human/mouse/rat)_gene_specificity.R. 

   E.g. for dataset gds3113 (on Linux):

   > cd gds3113  
   > R CMD BATCH simfile.r
   > R CMD BATCH human_genes_specificity.r

2. Before going to the folder (tissue_selective) run all five dataset folders.
