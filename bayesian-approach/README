Here are the steps to reproduce the results of the modified Bayesian 
approach presented in the manuscript "Combining evidence of preferential
Gene-Tissue relationships from multiple sources". Not all datasets 
that are in the manuscript are in here - only those that have replicates. 
Also, you do not need to run any of the scripts that are in the 
commonfiles directory.

1. Create a folder and extract the content of 
   Bayesian-tissue-specificity.rar. 
2. For each of the dataset folders (GDS596, GDS3113, GSE7307, GSE952, GSE9954) 
   run first simfile.R then the (human/mouse/rat)_gene_specificity.R. 

   E.g. for dataset gds3113 (on Linux):

   > cd gds3113  
   > R CMD BATCH simfile.r
   > R CMD BATCH human_genes_specificity.r

3. Before going to the folder (tissue_selective) run all five dataset folders.

Description of folders:

 commonfiles folder:
   The files in this folder calculates Bayes Factor for all Tissue Selective cases.
   
      "BF.R" # calculates the Bayes Factor for Tissue Specific case
      "BFN.R" # calculates the Bayes Factor for 2-Selective case
      "BFN3.R" # calculates the Bayes Factor for 3-Selective case
      "BFN4.R" # calculates the Bayes Factor for 4-Selective case

   The file "RMDUP.R" removes duplicate gene symbols in a dataset. The file "RMDUP1.R" removes 
   duplicate gene symbols in all five datasets by considering case sensitivity. The file "OVP.R" 
   calculates the overlap of gene symbols in two datasets.

 dataset folders:
   All five dataset folders (GDS596, GDS3113, GSE7307, GSE952, GSE9954) contain two files one is 
   "simfile.R" and "gene_specificity.R" along with the data and its annotation files. The file 
   "simfile.R" calculates Tissue Selective case for each probeset in the dataset. The Tissue 
   Selective cases are represented by numbers (1-4):

      Tissue Specific Case - 1
      2-Selective Case     - 2
      3-Selective Case     - 3
      4-Selective Case     - 4

   If a probeset in a dataset is 4-Selective then the top 4 higly expressed tissues are represented 
   by value 4 and rest of the tissues are represented by 0. Similarly for other tissue selective cases. 
   The output of the "simfile.R" is stored in to "gene_specificity_final.txt". 
   Sample of "gene_specificty_final.txt" file:
      GENESYMBOL  PROBESET TISSUE-1  TISSUE-2  ...   TISSUE-N
      CASP14   139705   0  0  ...   1  0  ...   0 # Tissue Specific Case (one tissue)
      FAM55D   122996   0  0  0  4  0  ...   4  4  4  0  ...   0 # 4-Selective case (four tissues)

   The file "gene_specificity.R" works on the output from "simfile.R" and writes list of tissue specific
   genes in to "dataset_specific.txt" file and similary for other tissue selective cases. The file
   "gene_specificity.R" creates four files for each dataset:

      (h/m/r)datasetnumber_specific.txt # contains gene symbols which are tissue specific
      (h/m/r)datasetnumber_2sel.txt # contains gene symbols which are 2-selective
      (h/m/r)datasetnumber_3sel.txt # contains gene symbols which are 3-selective
      (h/m/r)datasetnumber_4sel.txt # contains gene symbols which are 4-selective 

   h is human, m is mouse and r is rat.

 tissue_selective folder:
   The file "tissue_specific.R" calculates the overlap of Tissue Specific genes in all five datasets
   by removing the duplicate gene symbols.
   The file "tissue_2sel.R" calculates the overlap of 2-Selective genes in all five datasets by 
   removing the duplicate gene symbols.
   The file "tissue_3sel.R" calculates the overlap of 3-Selective genes in all five datasets by 
   removing the duplicate gene symbols.
   The file "tissue_4sel.R" calculates the overlap of 4-Selective genes in all five datasets by 
   removing the duplicate gene symbols.
